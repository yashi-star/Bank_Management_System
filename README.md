# Bank Management System (ATM Simulator System)
#Project Overview
The Bank Management System, also known as the ATM Simulator System, is a Java-based application developed to simulate basic banking and ATM functionalities. It offers a secure, user-friendly interface for managing bank accounts, allowing users to perform essential transactions like account creation, deposits, withdrawals, mini statements, and PIN changes. Designed as a modular application, this project provides a solid foundation for understanding core banking operations and the technology behind ATMs.

# Features
Account Creation: Enables customers to open a new bank account by entering essential personal details.
Deposit Funds: Allows customers to add money to their bank accounts.
Withdraw Funds: Facilitates cash withdrawals up to the available balance.
Mini Statement: Shows recent transactions for quick account history access.
PIN Change: Enables secure updating of account PIN for enhanced security.
These functionalities simulate an ATM environment, providing a virtual banking experience where customers can manage accounts from their devices.

# Project Aim
The primary objective of this project is to offer a simple, secure, and efficient online banking experience. The application is intended to provide a digital solution to perform banking transactions conveniently without visiting physical branches, supporting the concept of virtual banking.

# Technologies Used
Core Java (Swing & AWT): Provides the UI and backend logic for the application.
MySQL: Database for storing account details, transaction history, and user information securely.
IDE: Developed using Eclipse for enhanced Java application development.
Project Structure
User Interface (UI): Built using Swing and AWT, the UI provides an intuitive layout for interacting with the ATM simulator.
Database Integration: MySQL database stores user information, transaction logs, and account data, enabling secure data management.
Modules: Each feature (account creation, deposit, withdrawal, etc.) is developed as a separate module, following a modular approach to ensure scalability and easy maintenance.
